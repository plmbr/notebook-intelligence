For each release we list user-facing changes grouped as **Added**, **Changed**, **Fixed**, and **Removed**. Commits are squashed into the change that motivated them; the full git log remains the source of truth for low-level history.

<!-- <START NEW CHANGELOG ENTRY> -->

## [5.4.1] - unreleased

### Fixed

- **Saving Claude settings keeps keys the tab does not show.** The Claude settings tab saves the keys it renders when it opens, and the server stored that object in place of the old one. Any other `claude_settings` key was erased, including `jupyter_ui_tools_external` (#398), which is set by hand in `config.json`. `POST /notebook-intelligence/config` now merges a posted `claude_settings` onto the stored value. Settings saves also re-read `config.json` first, so a hand edit made while JupyterLab runs is no longer overwritten when a settings tab next saves.

## [5.4.0] - unreleased

5.4.0 adds a second agent mode (ACP, with Codex as the first agent type) alongside Claude mode, a way to serve NBI's Jupyter-UI tools to an agent running outside the Lab page, and two diagnostic surfaces for deployments where something is misconfigured or slow: a configuration readiness preflight that names the missing piece, and opt-in performance diagnostics with per-turn timelines. Every one of them is opt-in and defaults to off. No traitlet, env-var, REST route, or on-disk-format renames or removals.

### Added

- **Experimental ACP agent mode** (#378). A second agent mode that drives an external coding agent over the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/), with OpenAI Codex (via the `codex-acp` adapter) as the first selectable agent type. Adds an ACP tab in Settings with an agent-type dropdown, chat model, API key, and base URL; session listing and resume through the agent's own `session/list` and `session/load`; and streaming, tool-call, and permission-request handling that reuses NBI's existing confirmation flow. ACP mode and Claude mode are mutually exclusive: enabling one disables the other on save, and a hand-edited config that enables both resolves to Claude. Two new admin policies both default to `force-off` rather than `user-choice`: `acp_mode_policy` (`NBI_ACP_MODE_POLICY`), the off switch for the whole mode, and `acp_full_access_policy` (`NBI_ACP_FULL_ACCESS_POLICY`), which governs whether the agent may run tools without asking. While full access is `force-off`, NBI pins Codex to `approval_policy = untrusted` through the adapter's `-c` command-line override, so it asks before anything beyond trusted read-only commands. Credentials and model follow the same env-override locks as Claude (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `NBI_ACP_CHAT_MODEL`), and `NBI_ACP_AGENT_COMMAND` overrides the adapter command NBI launches. When an API key is configured, codex runs with an isolated `CODEX_HOME` under the NBI user directory so neither the workspace's nor the user's `~/.codex` config is read. See [Gating the experimental ACP agent](docs/admin-guide.md#gating-the-experimental-acp-agent-378).
- **Proxied Jupyter UI tools for external agents** (#398). NBI's Jupyter-UI tools (create and edit notebooks, run cells, open files, drive the terminal) were only reachable from the in-process MCP server NBI registers with the Claude SDK. Managed and enterprise Claude Code configurations can forbid dynamically configured MCP servers, which made those tools unavailable in exactly the deployments that most need them. A standalone stdio MCP server, `python -m notebook_intelligence.mcp_ui_proxy`, now serves the same tool manifest and relays each call over HTTP to the running Jupyter Server, so it can be declared in a static `mcp.json` like any other server. Setting `jupyter_ui_tools_external` in the Claude settings switches Claude mode from the in-process tools to the relay. The relay endpoint is `/notebook-intelligence/ui-tools` (GET for the manifest, POST to invoke); it requires Jupyter authentication like every other NBI route, and the proxy additionally sends a per-process bridge secret in an `X-NBI-UI-Tools-Token` header, which the relay uses only to exempt the call from the XSRF check (not as an identity). `NBI_UI_TOOLS_URL`, `NBI_UI_TOOLS_TOKEN`, `NBI_UI_TOOLS_SECRET`, `NBI_UI_TOOLS_HTTP_TIMEOUT`, and `NBI_UI_TOOLS_SERVER_NAME` configure the proxy when discovery cannot find the server on its own. See [Serving the Jupyter UI tools to an external agent](docs/admin-guide.md#serving-the-jupyter-ui-tools-to-an-external-agent-398).

- **Configuration readiness preflight** (#410). NBI Settings now opens on a Status card answering whether the deployment is configured to work and, if not, which specific piece is missing. Checks resolve the provider and model, confirm the model list is reachable and that the selected model is one the endpoint actually serves, and for the agent modes confirm the CLI answers `--version` and that credentials are present; a missing key is a warning rather than an error, because the Claude CLI and ACP agents can hold subscription logins NBI cannot see. Every row that is not `ok` carries a remedy naming the next action. `GET /notebook-intelligence/readiness` runs the checks that bill nothing. An opt-in `POST` with `{"live": true}` sends one short real request, which is the only way to catch a gateway that returns 200s but buffers instead of streaming, or a proxy that strips the `tools` field so agent mode silently never calls a tool; it is refused when `NBI_READINESS_LIVE_CHECK=off` (traitlet `readiness_live_check_allowed`) and returns 429 if one is already running. No model output is retained. See [Configuration readiness](docs/admin-guide.md#configuration-readiness).
- **Opt-in performance diagnostics** (#408). A Performance tab that answers "where did this turn's time go," aimed at internal LLM gateways, network home directories, and TLS-intercepting proxies. Each chat turn records a phase timeline (rule and context preparation, agent connect and spawn, time to first token, streaming with stall events, tool calls, time spent waiting on the user) plus token counts and the SDK-reported API duration, with a verdict naming the dominant phase; comparing active time against API time separates a slow gateway from a slow machine. An environment probe measures filesystem, subprocess, and optional network latency from the server's own vantage point. Off by default, and when off the cost is a single boolean check per instrumentation site. Attributes are redacted by default (paths hashed to basenames), turns are held in a capped ring buffer, and each turn is also summarized as one `perf turn ...` INFO line so headless installs get the same signal. `NBI_PERF_DIAGNOSTICS` locks the enabled state, `NBI_PERF_DIAGNOSTICS_POLICY` governs it fleet-wide, `NBI_PERF_PROBE_NETWORK=off` disables just the network check, and `NBI_PERF_LOG_DIR` redirects the optional JSONL log. See [`docs/performance-diagnostics.md`](docs/performance-diagnostics.md).
- **Separate model for inline chat** (#413). New optional `claude_settings.inline_chat_model` picks the model used by the inline chat popover, falling back to `chat_model` when unset so existing configs behave exactly as before. Inline chat calls the Anthropic API directly while the other Claude modes go through the Claude Code CLI, and the two transports do not accept the same model-id grammar: a CLI-only id spelling reaches the raw API verbatim and is rejected. Exposed as a collapsible "Inline chat model" control nested under Claude → Chat model, and pinnable via `NBI_CLAUDE_INLINE_CHAT_MODEL`. `NBI_CLAUDE_CHAT_MODEL` keeps governing both surfaces as it does today (while it is set the inline key is ignored and its control is disabled), so an existing pin loses no coverage on upgrade; pin the inline var as well to give the two transports different models.

### Changed

- **Dependency floors raised past known-vulnerable releases** (#399). `cryptography>=48.0.1`, `jupyter_server>=2.20.0`, `litellm>=1.83.7`, `mcp>=1.28.1`, `urllib3>=2.7.0`, `tornado>=6.5.7`, `starlette>=1.3.1`, `pydantic-settings>=2.14.2`, `aiohttp>=3.14.1`, `mistune>=3.3.0`, and `python-multipart>=0.0.27`, plus npm-side overrides for the transitive packages whose parents did not pin tightly enough. `mcp` is additionally capped below `2.0`: 2.x moved the FastMCP server out of the SDK, so `mcp.server.fastmcp.tools` no longer exists there and the server extension fails to load.
- **Chat response streams now finalize when participant handlers return** (#403). Participant implementations must complete streaming and UI-command work before their awaited `handle_chat_request` coroutine returns; detached post-return writes (including provider events arriving after a timeout) are logged and ignored so every request delivers exactly one terminal response. Cancelling a GitHub Copilot chat stream now also stops consuming later provider events.
- **Large cell-output and Claude terminal-tool results are bounded before returning to the agent** (#404). Oversized responses now retain their beginning and end with an explicit truncation marker instead of consuming the agent's context without limit, and cell-output tools accept optional `offset` and `limit` arguments so agents can retrieve omitted ranges. Source-returning and structured tools remain lossless, while unexpected structured values from the text-oriented cell-output and terminal bridges are stringified and bounded. Claude's approximate output budget defaults to 10,000 tokens and can be adjusted with `NBI_CLAUDE_TOOL_RESULT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`; set it to numeric zero to restore unbounded output.
- **Ask-mode chat requests are budgeted against the active model's context window** (#412). Prior conversation and current-turn context are now fitted to 80% of the model's input budget instead of being sent whole. System instructions, injected rules, required inline-edit source, an MCP prompt sequence, and the newest request are preserved, with the newest request truncated only when mandatory context cannot otherwise fit; older history is retained only as complete turns, so a tool-call exchange is never split. Fenced and multimodal context is dropped whole rather than cut mid-delimiter, and an omission notice is added when anything was left out. Agent tool loops are unchanged. OpenAI-compatible and LiteLLM-compatible providers require an explicit **Context window** setting; left blank, history is passed through unchanged rather than pruned against a guessed limit.

### Fixed

- **Claude inline edits now receive their intended system instructions and applicable workspace rules** (#405). The inline-edit prompt is forwarded through the Claude handler to Anthropic's `system` field instead of being silently dropped before generation. Injected repository guidance is capped against the model context window, and disabling rules now suppresses `AGENTS.md` instructions as well as configured rule files.
- **Empty code blocks no longer render as inline code with actions attached** (#407). A fenced block that streamed in empty was misclassified as an inline span, so the chat renderer offered copy and insert actions on nothing.
- **GitHub Copilot chat no longer sends an unsupported `stop` parameter** (#397). Chat requests carried `stop: ['<END>']` to `/chat/completions`, with `gpt-5` and `gpt-5-mini` excluded by literal id comparison after they began rejecting it. Every GPT-5 family model released since inherited that blind spot: selecting GPT-5.4 made chat unusable, with each message failing as `Unsupported parameter: 'stop' is not supported with this model`. The parameter is now omitted for every model on that endpoint. The `<END>` sentinel was never load-bearing there, and the model id does not predict which models reject it, so no id-keyed exclusion list can stay correct. Inline completions, which use a different endpoint where the sentinel does bound a completion, are unchanged.
- **AI-streamed code blocks no longer pick up trailing whitespace** (#384). The chat renderer ran a blanket `\n` to `  \n` string replace before markdown parsing, intended for user input but applied to every message, which injected two trailing spaces into every line of a streamed fenced code block and carried them into anything copy-pasted out. The pre-parse transform is gone; NBI now uses the `remark-breaks` plugin, which converts soft breaks to hard breaks at the AST level and is fence-aware, so prose still breaks on single newlines while code blocks are left alone in both directions.
- **Inline-code styling no longer leaks into fenced code blocks** (#401). `react-markdown` 9 stopped setting the `inline` prop, so the chat renderer's `inline || !match` branch also caught fenced blocks with an unrecognized or missing language and gave them the inline-code pill background; the visible symptom reported was a first-line indent on highlighted blocks, which is that rule's `padding: 1px 4px` landing on a `<code>` it was never meant to reach. Inline and fenced content are now told apart by content shape (`remark-rehype` appends a trailing newline to fenced code and never to an inline span), and the CSS targets an explicit `.inline-code` class instead of `:not(pre) > code`, which had itself been broken by the `PreTag="div"` wrapper the syntax highlighter inserts.
- **Korean and other IME composition needs only one Enter to submit** (#400). The chat input listened for `keydown` without checking composition state, so the Enter that commits an IME candidate also submitted the message, and users typing Hangul had to retype the last syllable. The handler now ignores Enter while a composition is in progress.

## [5.3.1] - 2026-07-29

A patch release: one skills-import fix. No traitlet, env-var, REST route, or on-disk-format changes.

### Fixed

- **The GitHub skill-import size cap applies to the skill subpath, not the whole repository** (#394). Importing a single skill from a large monorepo could be rejected because the cap was measured against every file in the archive rather than the subdirectory actually being imported, so legitimate imports failed on repository size alone.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-07-22

5.3.0 makes notebook work kernel-aware rather than Python-assuming, modernizes the Claude model defaults, and adds an opt-in per-turn usage footer. It also carries two workspace-containment fixes for the built-in file tools. One ruleset frontmatter key was removed; see the migration note.

### Migration note

- **`scope.kernels` is no longer accepted in ruleset frontmatter** (#379). The old key conflated a kernel name with a language. Rules now scope on `scope.languages` (the notebook's language, e.g. `python`) or `scope.kernel_names` (the kernelspec name, e.g. `python3`), and a rule file that still uses `scope.kernels` is rejected with a `ValueError` naming the file rather than being silently ignored. Update any rule that used it; see [Ruleset system](docs/rulesets.md).

### Added

- **Multi-language and kernel-aware notebook support** (#379). Notebook creation, cell insertion, and inline code generation previously assumed Python. NBI now resolves the active notebook's kernel and language and carries them through the chat context, the built-in toolsets, and the ruleset scope, so generated code matches the notebook it is going into. A `list-available-notebook-kernels` tool lets the agent enumerate installed kernelspecs instead of guessing a name, and the Claude system prompt instructs it to call that tool before creating a notebook in a language the current context has not established. Requesting a notebook in a kernel that is not installed now raises instead of silently falling back to Python.
- **Opt-in per-turn usage footer in Claude mode** (#391). The Claude SDK ends every turn with a `ResultMessage` carrying duration, token counts, and a cost estimate, which NBI previously discarded. Setting `show_turn_usage` in the Claude settings (default off) appends a one-line italic footer to each completed turn. The `$` cost segment is shown only when NBI is running against a direct Anthropic API key on Anthropic's own endpoint: the SDK prices from the CLI's built-in public list rates, so on a subscription login the marginal cost is really zero and on a custom `base_url` the endpoint's pricing is unknown. Duration and token counts, which are always accurate, are shown either way.
- **Inline-completion and inline-chat acceptance are tracked as distinct telemetry events** (#383). Acceptance of a ghost-text completion and acceptance of an inline-chat edit were previously indistinguishable. JupyterLab's inline-completer provider interface has no accept callback, so NBI wraps JupyterLab's own `IInlineCompleterFactory` and patches `accept()` on the widget instance rather than subclassing the completer. The factory is taken as an optional dependency, so NBI still loads if JupyterLab stops providing it. See [Telemetry events](docs/admin-guide.md#telemetry-events).

### Changed

- **Claude model defaults modernized, and inline-completion output bounded** (#389). The chat default resolves to `claude-sonnet-5` and the inline-completion default to `claude-haiku-4-5`, both resolved against the live model list rather than a hardcoded id, with a version-aware fallback within the tier (a bogus `claude-sonnet-99` resolves to the newest Sonnet, not a lexicographic pick). Because the Models API lists Haiku only under its dated id, the inline default resolves to that snapshot and logs an INFO line at startup; that line is expected, not an error. Inline-completion output is capped at 1024 tokens instead of 10,000, since a suggestion is at most a few dozen lines and the old ceiling let a rambling response generate for seconds before the extraction regex discarded most of it. `NBI_CLAUDE_INLINE_COMPLETION_MAX_TOKENS` overrides the cap and is clamped to `[1, 4096]`. The fetched model list is cached per endpoint, so switching `base_url` no longer reuses the previous endpoint's models.
- **Context token budget derives from the Claude model in Claude mode** (#390). The budget was computed from the general chat model's context window even when Claude mode was active, so history was trimmed against the wrong number.

### Fixed

- **`search_files` reads are confined to the workspace** (#386). The tool sandboxed only the search root, then opened each glob hit directly, so a symlink inside the workspace pointing outside it (`leak.txt -> /etc/passwd`) let an agent-mode model read arbitrary host files through `content_pattern` matches. `read_file` already routed every path through the workspace gate and rejected outbound symlinks after resolution; `search_files` now does the same for each match. Confidentiality only, no write path.
- **Outbound symlinks are no longer stat-followed during enumeration** (#387). The directory-descent check called `is_dir(follow_symlinks=True)` on a symlink's target before testing that target for workspace containment. The containment check still rejected it afterwards, so nothing was read, but the probe itself reached past the workspace boundary. The path is now resolved and range-checked first, and only an in-workspace target is stat'd. No behavior change beyond that.
- **Attachment context survives a slash-command prompt** (#388). When the last user line started with `/`, the CLI query assembly kept only that line and silently discarded the context lines NBI had just appended for the same turn: attachment `@`-mentions, cell pointers, and output context. Control-only commands (`/clear`, `/cost`, and friends) still drop the context, since it means nothing to them, but any other command is now moved to the front of the query, where the CLI expects it, with the context lines preserved after it. Custom skill and plugin commands therefore receive the user's attachments.
- **Kernel-scoped rules apply to inline code generation** (#379). Inline generation did not pass the notebook's kernel into rule selection, so rules scoped to a kernel or language never matched there.

## [5.2.1] - 2026-06-26

A patch release: one Claude-mode timeout fix. No traitlet, env-var, REST route, or on-disk-format changes.

### Fixed

- **A turn waiting on a user prompt no longer times out** (#381). Time spent blocked on the user counted toward the agent response timeout, so an approval left on screen for about 30 minutes failed the turn with "Claude agent response timeout" while the worker was still mid-request, and the orphaned request then wedged the next prompt. NBI now tracks the wall-clock time a turn spends waiting on input (every tool approval, plan confirmation, and question) and subtracts it from the timeout window, so a slow human reply no longer looks like an unresponsive agent while a genuine post-approval hang still trips the timeout. The user-input listener is also disconnected in a `finally`, so a cancelled turn cannot leak the subscription. Because a parked approval no longer self-resolves via the timeout, in-flight requests are cancelled when the WebSocket closes: an abandoned turn (the user closes the tab) tears down its worker thread and the Claude subprocess instead of spinning until the process exits.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-06-18

5.2.0 adds the Claude permission-mode selector to the chat input, halves the server-extension import cost by deferring provider SDK imports, and makes three Claude-CLI integration points honor `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. One new admin policy (`claude_bypass_permissions_policy`), which defaults to `force-off`; no traitlet, env-var, REST route, or on-disk-format renames or removals.

### Added

- **Claude permission-mode selector in the chat input** (#359). An icon button in the input footer opens a menu to switch between Default, Accept Edits, and Plan; the selected mode rides each request and takes effect immediately, replacing the `/enter-plan-mode` and `/exit-plan-mode` slash commands (still working as hidden aliases for one release, but no longer autocompleted). "Bypass Permissions", which skips NBI's tool-call confirmation entirely, is gated behind the new `claude_bypass_permissions_policy` traitlet / `NBI_CLAUDE_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS_POLICY` env var defaulting to `force-off` (the only policy that does); when an admin sets `user-choice`, the option appears but must be armed through an explicit confirm step, shows a persistent red indicator while armed, and never survives a new session (it resets to default on `/clear` and on a fresh SDK client). The mode is clamped server-side on every request, and NBI defers to Claude Code's enterprise managed settings: `permissions.disableBypassPermissionsMode` refuses bypass regardless of the NBI policy, and `permissions.defaultMode` seeds the selector's starting mode (bypass excepted).

### Changed

- **Provider SDKs load on first use instead of at module import** (#370). `import notebook_intelligence` no longer imports `litellm`, `openai`, `ollama`, or the `anthropic` SDK; `litellm`, `openai`, and `anthropic` load the first time their provider is actually used (for Claude mode that includes the client construction and model refresh NBI runs at startup), while `ollama` still loads during extension startup when the provider enumerates local models. This roughly halves the server-extension import time (a cost the Jupyter server pays on every start), with the biggest effect on Windows machines where antivirus scanning amplifies the many-small-file SDK imports (#368). When NBI does load litellm, it now defaults `LITELLM_LOCAL_MODEL_COST_MAP=true` so litellm reads its bundled model-cost map rather than fetching it over HTTP at import; set the env var to `false` to restore the fetch.

### Fixed

- **Session history follows `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`** (#373). The chat-sidebar resume picker and the launcher tile's session list always read transcripts from `~/.claude/projects`, so both came up empty when the Claude CLI was configured with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and wrote its transcripts elsewhere. The session listing now resolves the CLI's config dir the same way the skills and spinner-verbs paths already did.
- **User-scope MCP config and the plugin cache follow `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`** (#375). The MCP management tab read user-scope servers from `~/.claude.json` even though the CLI relocates that file to `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json` when the override is set (so reads and CLI-mediated writes diverged), and the Plugins panel's cache fallback pointed at `~/.claude/plugins` instead of the relocated cache. Both now resolve the CLI's actual locations; `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` still wins for the plugin cache when set.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-06-08

5.1.0 builds on 5.0.x with a focus on Claude-mode agent visibility. Tool calls the agent runs now render as persistent status cards with inline diffs and collapsible grouping, the generating indicator can cycle custom verbs, and cancelling a turn tears down the whole process tree the agent spawned instead of leaking it. It also adds two opt-in security guardrails (an MCP stdio-command allowlist and a default-token-password check on shared filesystems) and an always-visible mode for chat feedback. No traitlet, env-var, REST route, or on-disk-format renames or removals; every new admin surface is opt-in and listed below.

### Upgrade note

If you installed NBI before the 5.0 npm-scope rename (from `@notebook-intelligence/notebook-intelligence` to `@plmbr/notebook-intelligence`) and now see **two Notebook Intelligence icons** in the sidebar, an old labextension is lingering alongside the new one and JupyterLab is loading both. Run `jupyter labextension list`; if both scopes show as enabled, remove the stale `@notebook-intelligence` labextension directory. See [Two Notebook Intelligence icons in the sidebar](docs/troubleshooting.md#two-notebook-intelligence-icons-in-the-sidebar) (#367).

### Added

- **Claude agent tool calls render as persistent status cards** (#358). Each tool the agent runs in Claude mode appears as its own card showing a kind icon (read / edit / execute / other), a humanized label, and a live status (in progress, completed, failed, cancelled) that stays on screen after the turn ends instead of scrolling away as transient progress text. Built-in and `mcp__<server>__<tool>` names map to friendly labels, with a sentence-case fallback for unknown tools.
- **Inline diffs, collapsible grouping, and unified tool maps for tool-call cards** (#360). Edit-style tools (`Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Write`, and their MCP-wrapped variants) show an inline add/remove diff on the card, capped and truncation-marked for large changes. A run of consecutive tool calls collapses into a single expandable group so a tool-heavy turn reads as one unit rather than a wall of rows; large settled groups start collapsed, live ones stay expanded. The kind/label lookups are unified into one map shared by the humanizer and the categorizer.
- **Custom Claude spinner verbs** (#356). When Claude mode is active, NBI reads `spinnerVerbs.verbs` from `~/.claude/settings.json` and cycles them in the generating label (Fisher-Yates shuffle, 4-7s per verb, no immediate repeats) instead of a static "Generating". The current verb is mirrored into a hidden `aria-live` region so screen readers announce verb changes without re-reading every elapsed-seconds tick.
- **Always-visible chat feedback** (#354). New `enable_chat_feedback_always_visible` traitlet (default `False`, requires `enable_chat_feedback = True`) renders the thumbs up/down buttons at full opacity on every assistant reply instead of revealing them on hover, and drops the post-`StreamEnd` gate so they appear with the reply. The thumbs tooltips are reworded to "Good response" / "Bad response" (screen readers announce "Rate response as good" / "Rate response as bad").
- **Admin allowlist for stdio MCP server commands** (#298). New `mcp_stdio_command_allowlist` traitlet and `NBI_MCP_STDIO_COMMAND_ALLOWLIST` env var (CSV, appended to the traitlet at startup). When non-empty, every stdio MCP server (added via Claude `mcp add` or loaded from `mcp.json`) must match at least one `re.search` regex or the admin gate rejects it; the empty default means no enforcement, so per-user deployments are unchanged. See [Restricting MCP stdio commands](docs/admin-guide.md#restricting-mcp-stdio-commands).
- **Default-token-password guardrails on shared filesystems** (#302). The GitHub Copilot token storage path now logs a per-process warning the first time it reads or writes the stored token while the public default `NBI_GH_ACCESS_TOKEN_PASSWORD` is in use, escalated when `~/.jupyter/nbi/` is group- or other-accessible. Setting `NBI_REFUSE_DEFAULT_TOKEN_PASSWORD_ON_SHARED_FS=1` upgrades that to a hard refusal of the write when both conditions hold; `NBI_ALLOW_DEFAULT_TOKEN_PASSWORD=1` opts back out per pod. The shared-directory check is POSIX-only and the refusal is opt-in, so single-user deployments are unaffected.
- **Claude Code vs NBI chat performance benchmark suite** (#350). A standalone suite under `benchmarks/claude_perf/` compares response times between the `claude -p` terminal CLI and NBI's chat WebSocket path (time to first token, wall time, tokens, cost), with a runner that interleaves the two paths and separates cold from warm runs. Developer tooling; not shipped in the extension.
- **Opt-in Prettier pre-commit hook and editor format-on-save** (#355). A husky + lint-staged hook formats staged files on commit, alongside EditorConfig and VS Code format-on-save settings. Developer tooling.

### Changed

- **Notebook-agent prompts and tool responses** (#351). Notebook editing/execution prompts now encourage incremental analysis and intermediate validation rather than generating a whole notebook in one pass; `add-code-cell` and `add-markdown-cell` return the inserted `cellIndex` for traceability; and `read_file` caps its output with UTF-8-safe truncation so large reads stay within a budget.
- **Expandable parameter/detail boxes use a flat fill** instead of the inner-glow effect (#361), for a cleaner read in both light and dark themes.

### Fixed

- **Cancelling a Claude turn tears down the whole process tree** the agent spawned (#357). A cancel previously killed only the direct `claude` CLI child, leaking reparented shells, MCP servers, and dev servers that accumulated across cancels and restarts; NBI now reaps the agent's descendants, gracefully then forcefully, without signalling the Jupyter server's own process group.
- **Claude session-resume commands are shell-quoted** (#349). Resume launches route through the shared command builder and quote the transcript-derived session id, so malicious session metadata cannot break out of `claude --resume` into shell execution.
- **Forged upload-context paths are rejected** (#348). WebSocket upload attachments must resolve under the server upload root before an image read or Claude file mention uses the supplied path, closing the forged `isUpload` path that could point chat context at arbitrary server-readable files outside the workspace.
- **Tool-call diffs are readable in dark theme and the tool-call group no longer flickers** (#360, #364). Diff add/remove lines use semi-transparent tints over the card so the theme's own text color stays legible in both themes (the `--jp-*-color3` fills were light pastels in both); and the streaming response keeps a stable message identity, so the tool-call group no longer expands and collapses on its own as calls arrive.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-05-24

A patch release: one provider-compatibility fix, one chat-rendering fix, and the npm package-scope rename. No traitlet, env-var, REST route, or on-disk-format changes; no migration steps beyond the 5.0.0 note.

### Changed

- **GitHub Copilot Codex chat models route through the `/responses` endpoint** (#341). Codex-family models (e.g. `gpt-5.3-codex`) are served only by Copilot's OpenAI Responses API mirror and return HTTP 400 on the standard `/chat/completions` path, so selecting one in the chat-model dropdown previously failed. NBI now picks the endpoint per model from the `/models` catalog's `supported_endpoints` field (with a `codex` substring fallback for offline sessions), translates the request and streaming events to the Responses shape, and surfaces `response.failed` / `response.error` / `response.incomplete` / `error` events instead of an empty turn. No new settings; the dispatch is internal to the GitHub Copilot provider.
- **npm package scope renamed to `@plmbr/notebook-intelligence`** (#342), following the GitHub org rename from `notebook-intelligence` to `plmbr`. The labextension is now listed as `@plmbr/notebook-intelligence` in `jupyter labextension list`; the pip package name (`notebook-intelligence`) is unchanged, so `pip install notebook-intelligence` still works.

### Fixed

- **AI-generated links in the chat sidebar open in a new tab instead of replacing the JupyterLab UI** (#347). Markdown links emitted by the model previously navigated the top-level document and unloaded the whole Lab session on click. External links (`http` / `https` / `mailto`) now open with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`; workspace-relative paths open the referenced file through JupyterLab's document manager; fragment-only links render as inert text; and disallowed schemes (`javascript:`, traversal-escaping paths, dangerous codepoints) are blocked.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-05-22

5.0.0 is a major release built on top of 4.8.0, gathering a large surface of new admin policies, accessibility work across the chat sidebar / popovers / settings tabs, several security hardening passes, and three new agent-aware UI surfaces. Most existing configuration continues to work; the version bump reflects the breadth of new admin-policy / env-var surface that operators should review, plus the dependency swap from `fastmcp` to the official `mcp` SDK.

### Migration note

5.0.0 ships no traitlet, env-var, REST route, or NBI-owned on-disk format renames or removals. Four items operators should review before upgrading:

- **`fastmcp` is no longer a dependency** (#324). NBI now uses the official `mcp` SDK via a thin internal shim. If your image pinned `fastmcp` because prior docs recommended it, drop that pin. If you have downstream Python code that imported `fastmcp` transitively via NBI, declare `fastmcp` as a direct dependency in your own image.
- **Shell tool and Claude UI-bridge tool paths are now sandboxed to `jupyter_root`** (#290, #323). An agent-supplied absolute path or `..` traversal that previously resolved outside the workspace is now rejected. Workflows that relied on the agent reaching outside the workspace via these tools need to move that data into the workspace.
- **Session listing no longer reads `~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/history.jsonl`** (#310). No action required: the unified inventory walks `~/.claude/projects/` directly, and a stale or missing `history.jsonl` no longer hides resumable sessions.
- **Workspace file attach in Claude mode ships an `@`-mention pointer instead of inlined file content** (#327). Behavior change visible to end users (images, large files, and notebooks now work where they didn't); no admin action required, but Claude's Read tool counts toward tool-use quotas that the prior content-injection path did not.
- **Copilot WebSocket upgrades require Jupyter session authentication and pass an origin check** (#301). Cross-origin and unauthenticated upgrade attempts that previously succeeded against `WebsocketCopilotHandler` now return 403. If you have a custom client outside the JupyterLab page hitting this endpoint, it needs to pipe through Jupyter's auth (token or cookie) and either set its `Origin` to the lab's origin or have it added to `c.ServerApp.allow_origin`.

### Added

#### Settings: three new top-level tabs and policy gates

- **Skills as a top-level Settings tab** (#224). Promoted from a Claude-mode sub-tab; visible in any mode, with a hint banner when Claude mode is off. New admin policy `skills_management_policy` (env `NBI_SKILLS_MANAGEMENT_POLICY`); `force-off` hides the tab, returns HTTP 403 from every `/notebook-intelligence/skills/*` route, and suppresses the managed-skills reconciler.
- **Claude MCP Servers tab** (#225) for managing the user, project, and local-scope MCP entries Claude Code reads from `~/.claude.json` and `<project>/.mcp.json`. Independent of the existing NBI MCP tab; the two never appear at the same time. New admin policy `claude_mcp_management_policy` (env `NBI_CLAUDE_MCP_MANAGEMENT_POLICY`).
- **Claude Plugins tab** (#226) wrapping `claude plugin` for install / uninstall / enable / disable / marketplace add. New admin policies `claude_plugins_management_policy` (env `NBI_CLAUDE_PLUGINS_MANAGEMENT_POLICY`) and `allow_github_plugin_import` (env `NBI_ALLOW_GITHUB_PLUGIN_IMPORT`), the latter mirroring `allow_github_skill_import` for marketplace sources.
- **Plugin marketplace picker** (#284). Browse the configured marketplaces and install plugins inline; the picker shows source repo, version, and description for each entry.
- **Plugin marketplace details + Update button** (#303). The Plugins tab now displays each installed plugin's description, author, version, and source, and surfaces a per-plugin **Update** button when a newer version is available upstream.
- **Per-workspace MCP server disable** for Claude mode (#286). Toggle individual MCP entries on/off without removing them, scoped to the current Jupyter workspace.
- **JSON-paste path in the Add MCP server dialog** (#285). Paste a Claude / Cursor / VS Code MCP config blob; NBI parses, validates, and pre-fills the form.
- **GitHub auth for plugin marketplace add**. Marketplace sources that resolve as GitHub URLs or `owner/repo` shorthand reuse Skills' `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` / `gh auth token` precedence; tokens are injected into the `claude plugin marketplace add` subprocess via env, never argv.

#### Launchers

- **Launcher tiles for opencode, Pi, and GitHub Copilot CLI** (#268), with follow-ons for **OpenAI Codex** and brand icons for Codex and opencode (#333). Each tile appears when the corresponding binary is on `PATH` and opens a Jupyter terminal at the file-browser's current directory. CLI path overrides: `NBI_OPENCODE_CLI_PATH`, `NBI_PI_CLI_PATH`, `NBI_GITHUB_COPILOT_CLI_PATH`, `NBI_CODEX_CLI_PATH`. Capabilities response gains matching `*_cli_available` booleans.
- **Coding-agent launcher tiles can be hidden by admin policy** (#288). New traitlet `disabled_coding_agent_launchers` (list of `claude-code` / `opencode` / `pi` / `github-copilot-cli` / `codex`) with an optional `allow_enabling_coding_agent_launchers_with_env` + `NBI_ENABLED_CODING_AGENT_LAUNCHERS` per-pod re-enable mechanism. The Coding Agent section header now uses the sparkles icon instead of the Claude orange so the section is correctly framed when other tiles are enabled (#325).
- **Claude Code launcher tile is no longer gated by Claude chat mode** (#239); it appears whenever the `claude` CLI is on `PATH`.
- **Choose a start directory from the launcher tile** (#332). Clicking any coding-agent tile (or "New Session" on the Claude resume dialog) opens a directory picker so the terminal starts where the user wants.

#### Chat sidebar and agentic UX

- **Real progress feedback during long Claude tasks** (#254). Elapsed-time counter, heartbeat-driven pulse with a "may be slow" copy flip after 30 seconds, and inline tool-call narration.
- **"New chat session" button** in the chat sidebar header restarts the Claude SDK client, mirroring `/clear` (#246).
- **Terminal drag-drop file attach** with `@`-mention or shell-escaped raw modes and a per-terminal toolbar toggle (#256). New admin policy `NBI_TERMINAL_DRAG_DROP_POLICY`; tunables `NBI_UPLOAD_MAX_MB` (default `50`) and `NBI_UPLOAD_RETENTION_HOURS` (default `24`) govern the shared upload-staging endpoint used by both terminal drops and chat-sidebar attachments.
- **Workspace files attach as `@`-mention in Claude mode** (#327). Instead of reading file contents client-side and injecting them as a fenced code block, the backend emits an `@<workspace-relative-path>` pointer and Claude's Read tool decides what to load. Unblocks images, large files, and notebooks (cell-aware reads) that the content-injection path couldn't handle. Notebook cell-pointer prose and text-selection line ranges are preserved so deictic references ("explain this cell", "why is this broken") still have a referent.
- **Hover preview for image context thumbnails** (#267).
- **Reload open document tabs when their files change on disk** (#330, relocated in #339). Polls every open `DocumentWidget` and reverts via `context.revert()` when disk is newer than the in-memory model, skipping when the tab has unsaved local edits. New user setting `refresh_open_files_on_disk_change` (default `true`); flip in the **NBI Settings dialog → External changes**. Closes the agentic-experience gap where Claude edits a file but the open tab keeps showing the pre-edit version. Admins can pin via the matching `NBI_REFRESH_OPEN_FILES_ON_DISK_CHANGE_POLICY` env var or `refresh_open_files_on_disk_change_policy` traitlet.
- **First-run tour of the chat sidebar** (#304). Highlights the gear, file-attach button, chat-mode dropdown, and (when available) the Claude session history icon. Replays from the command palette via "Show NBI tour"; capability-aware so steps for unavailable CLIs are skipped.
- **Steered the Claude system prompt away from over-eager notebook creation** (#336). The agent now defaults to answering questions in chat instead of creating a new notebook to hold the answer when the user attaches a file and asks a question about it.

#### Copilot models

- **Dynamic GitHub Copilot model discovery** (#269). NBI queries `https://api.githubcopilot.com/models` on each Copilot token refresh and rebuilds the chat-model dropdown from the live response, falling back to a hardcoded list on transient failure.
- **Newer GitHub Copilot chat models** added to the fallback list (#255).

#### Skills and workspace config

- **Multi-manifest support** in `NBI_SKILLS_MANIFEST` / `skills_manifest` (#321). Comma-separated list of URLs and/or filesystem paths; manifests are unioned with first-wins URL dedupe and per-entry name-collision surfacing. See [`docs/skills.md`](docs/skills.md#managed-skills-via-an-org-manifest).
- **Tracks-upstream flag for user-imported GitHub skills** (#322). The Import-from-GitHub dialog adds a **Track upstream** checkbox; tracked skills get a per-skill Sync button and a panel-level **Sync tracking skills** button. Mutually exclusive with the managed-skills reconciler: a skill the reconciler installs can't also be marked tracking.
- **HTTP kill switch for the managed-skills reconciler** (#291). `POST /notebook-intelligence/skills/reconciler/stop` is authenticated, idempotent, and intentionally has no `/start` companion (a kill switch a script can flip back on isn't a kill switch). The reconciler also re-reads `NBI_SKILLS_MANAGEMENT_POLICY` at the start of each cycle and self-stops when it reads `force-off`.
- **Skill GitHub archive cap raised to 100 MB**, configurable (#257). New traitlet `skill_max_archive_mb` (env `NBI_SKILL_MAX_ARCHIVE_MB`); `0` disables the cap.
- **`additional_skipped_workspace_directories` accepted in NBI `config.json`** (#241), layered additively on top of the existing traitlet, env, and env-prefix layers so a per-user override extends rather than replaces the org-wide list.

### Changed

#### Accessibility (chat sidebar, popovers, settings)

A multi-PR accessibility pass landed across most NBI surfaces. Together these make NBI navigable end-to-end with the keyboard and screen-reader, audited under JupyterLab's light, dark, and high-contrast themes:

- **Chat-sidebar header icons** are real keyboard-reachable buttons (#205, #305) with distinct titles / `aria-label`s and a button reset to avoid double-borders.
- **Settings tabs** are an ARIA tablist with arrow-key navigation (#206).
- **Workspace, tools, and slash popovers** are keyboard-first (#306), with focus restoration to the trigger element on close.
- **Settings checkboxes** have the WAI-ARIA `checkbox` role and respond to Space activation (#309).
- **Ask-User-Question form** uses `radio` for single-select choices, stable per-form `useId`-driven labels, and real form semantics (#307).
- **Claude MCP form** wires every input to a `<label>` (#308).
- **"Open notebook" link in chat replies** is a real button with the notebook path in its accessible name (#311).
- **Skills panel icons** render as real SVGs with focus-reveal styling; the nested-button wrapper is gone (#312).
- **Send button** swaps its color to the warn-token and updates its `aria-label` while a request is in flight (#313).
- **Inline-completion popover** uses JupyterLab theme tokens instead of a fixed pastel background so it reads correctly under dark/high-contrast themes (#314).
- **Upload-in-progress chip** announces via `role=status`, `aria-live=polite`, `aria-busy=true`, plus an animated ellipsis with `prefers-reduced-motion` honored (#315).
- **Drop-zone chip** uses theme-aware foreground color so the text is legible against the brand-tinted background (#316).
- **Generating-state rotating border** pauses under `prefers-reduced-motion` (#317).
- **Streaming chat replies** announce through an `aria-live=polite` region with chunked boundary announcements (#318).
- **Visually-hidden skip-to-message-input link** as the first focusable child of the sidebar (#319). Lets keyboard users jump past long transcripts to the prompt input.
- **Global Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+L shortcut** focuses the NBI chat input from anywhere in the app (#320).

- **Chat-input footer icons reworded** for clarity; the gear button gains a `title` attribute (#271).
- **Cell-tool descriptions** mention zero-based indexing so models pick the right cell (#265).

### Removed

- **`fastmcp` dependency**, replaced with the official `mcp` SDK (#324). NBI's external behavior is unchanged; downstream code that imported `fastmcp` transitively via NBI now needs to depend on it directly.
- **`history.jsonl` as the gate for session listing** (#310). The unified inventory walks the projects directory directly.

### Fixed

- **Websocket writes from worker threads** no longer raise `BufferError` after `/clear` or "new chat" on Python 3.13+ (#270). All emitter writes route through `tornado.IOLoop.call_soon_threadsafe`.
- **WebSocket message-callback handlers** are freed when requests finish, preventing slow accumulation over the lifetime of a session (#294).
- **Claude session listing** unified across the chat-sidebar picker and the launcher tile; both surfaces read the same on-disk transcript inventory and apply the same "show this session?" filter so they no longer disagree (#310). The legacy `history.jsonl` gate is removed.
- **Claude session preview** correctly strips the NBI context preamble when `claude.py` joined it onto the user's actual prompt (#331). Single-turn sessions previously showed a blank title; now they show the prompt.
- **Refresh-on-disk watcher** no longer throws `Invalid area: down` on every poll (post-#330 follow-up). The TS `Area` union lists `'down'`, but `LabShell.widgets()` doesn't implement it.
- **Cell tools** follow the active notebook when the user switches tabs (#253).
- **`is_connected()`** stabilized against the Claude worker-spawn resurrection race (#250).
- **Persisted Claude model** now displays after a JupyterLab restart (#244).
- **`/clear` no longer duplicated** in the `@`-mention autocomplete (#243).
- **`@`-mention picker** refreshes when workspace files change (#251) and closes on Escape from the search input (#266).
- **Notebook-toolbar prompt textarea** focuses when the popover opens (#240); the update button works outside Claude mode (#238).
- **Inline chat** anchors to the cursor line (#191).
- **Disabled send button** styled neutrally instead of as a primary action (#276); Claude tool-result check renders on the right of its label (#277).
- **Plugin Settings row** shows the plugin name even when the CLI returns only `id` (#280).

### Security

- **Shell tool's `working_directory` is sandboxed to `jupyter_root`** (#290). A previously-permitted absolute path or `..` traversal in agent-supplied input is now rejected; the existing path-safety helper handles the canonicalization.
- **Claude UI-bridge tool paths sandboxed to `jupyter_root`** (#323). `open_file_in_jupyter_ui` and `run_command_in_jupyter_terminal` both route through `safe_jupyter_path` so an agent can't reach files outside the workspace via these tools. The Claude Agent SDK subprocess is itself rooted at `jupyter_root` via its `cwd` option.
- **Encrypted GitHub token file enforces mode 0o600** (#293). The file holding the AES-GCM-encrypted Copilot token is created and re-tightened to owner-only read/write on every save, so an out-of-band `chmod` that widens permissions is undone on the next write.
- **Process-env secrets are scrubbed from shell-tool output** (#295). The shell tool no longer leaks `API_KEY` / `TOKEN` / `SECRET`-like env values into the captured stdout/stderr block returned to the model.
- **MCP user config shape validated before persisting** (#299). Malformed entries in the JSON paste / Add-MCP dialog are rejected server-side (unknown keys, type/command/url consistency, etc.); the client surfaces the rejection as a notification rather than writing through.
- **Anchor URIs in chat messages filtered against an XSS allowlist** (#296). `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, and tab/NEL/bidi-override codepoint smuggling are blocked at render time.
- **Copilot WebSocket upgrades authenticated and origin-checked** (#301). Cross-origin and unauthenticated upgrade attempts are refused.
- **GitHub Enterprise host detection for marketplace add** (#292), so a `git.acme.example.com` URL routes through the GHE token / API path instead of being misclassified as public GitHub. Hardened against trailing-dot, userinfo, and other URL-shape edge cases.
- **`fastmcp` dropped in favor of the official `mcp` Python SDK** (#324). `fastmcp` pinned `python-dotenv>=1.1.0` which conflicted with `litellm`'s `python-dotenv==1.0.1` pin; the swap unblocks installs on Python 3.14 and picks up CVE fixes via `urllib3>=2.7.0` (CVE-2026-44431 / CVE-2026-44432).
- **Runtime kill switch for the managed-skills reconciler** (#291) provides per-pod incident response without a server restart. See the Skills entry above for the user-facing affordances and the [admin guide](docs/admin-guide.md#disabling-the-skills-tab) for the route and self-stop semantics.

### Internal

- **CVE-driven dependency upgrades** (#197); `react-icons` bumped to `~5.6.0` (#245).
- **Galata-based Playwright UI test suite scaffolded** (#207) and expanded with user-flow specs covering the chat sidebar, notebook toolbar, cell outputs, and the launcher (#272).
- **Docs refresh across README, admin guide, skills, and CHANGELOG** (#287) covering the post-4.8.0 surface that this release expands on.
- **Stop tracking local AI-assistant config files** (`.codex/`, `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock`) via `.gitignore` so they don't clutter the diff when contributors run the agents inside the repo.
- **Contributor docs** cover the traitlet vs env var vs config-file decision (#242).

<!-- <END NEW CHANGELOG ENTRY> -->

## [4.8.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **`allow_github_skill_import` traitlet** (env `NBI_ALLOW_GITHUB_SKILL_IMPORT`) gating user-initiated skill imports from GitHub independently of the managed-skills reconciler (#222). When `False`, the **Import from GitHub** button hides and `/skills/import` returns HTTP 403.
- **Workspace picker honors `.gitignore`** and gains the `additional_skipped_workspace_directories` traitlet (env `NBI_ADDITIONAL_SKIPPED_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORIES`, layered additively) for extending the built-in skip list (#223). Dot-prefixed files are also skipped by default (#221).
- Workspace file scan in the `@`-mention picker now runs in parallel (#227).

### Changed

- Skill imports from GitHub block and scope HTTP redirects, including refusing HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrades (#203).
- Settings tab content scrolls correctly when its body is taller than the dialog (#228); the tab bar styling is standardized across tabs.

### Fixed

- `NBIConfig.save()` is atomic (#202): symlinks are preserved, file mode is preserved across the swap, and the rename is parent-dir fsynced. Prevents the corrupt-config failure mode where a crash mid-write left an empty `config.json`.
- The NBI notebook toolbar is disabled outside Claude mode where its buttons did not work (#228); a stray new-notebook button was removed.

## [4.7.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Cell output actions** — right-click a cell output (or hover for the toolbar) for **Explain**, **Ask**, and **Troubleshoot** quick actions that open the chat sidebar with the output already attached as context. Outputs forward as structured MIME bundles and include images for vision-capable models, token-bounded so large outputs don't overflow the context window. Per-user toggles in `config.json` (`enable_explain_error`, `enable_output_followup`, `enable_output_toolbar`, default on); admins can lock them via `NBI_EXPLAIN_ERROR_POLICY` / `NBI_OUTPUT_FOLLOWUP_POLICY` / `NBI_OUTPUT_TOOLBAR_POLICY`.
- **Image attachments in chat** — paste or attach images alongside a prompt; the image goes to the model as input when it's vision-capable.
- **Streaming inline-chat responses** — the inline chat popover now streams tokens as they arrive instead of waiting for the full response.
- **Notebook toolbar generation button** — a sparkle icon on the active notebook's toolbar opens a popover that scopes the generation to that notebook.
- **Claude Code launcher tile** — a Claude Code tile in the JupyterLab launcher opens a session picker (resume a transcript or start a new one in the file browser's active subdirectory). Session IDs are copyable from the picker.
- **Repo-level `AGENTS.md`** — when a project root contains `AGENTS.md`, NBI appends it under the system prompt's "Additional Guidelines" alongside the existing ruleset injection.
- **Claude WebSocket heartbeat** — keeps long-running Claude agent requests alive through upstream proxy / load balancer idle timeouts (e.g. JupyterHub's nginx default of 60s) by sending a status heartbeat every 20s while a request is in flight. Fixes Bedrock-style request failures where processing exceeds the proxy idle window.
- **Extended admin policy coverage** — every Settings panel toggle is now lockable via an env var. New boolean policies: `NBI_CLAUDE_MODE_POLICY`, `NBI_CLAUDE_CONTINUE_CONVERSATION_POLICY`, `NBI_CLAUDE_CODE_TOOLS_POLICY`, `NBI_CLAUDE_JUPYTER_UI_TOOLS_POLICY`, `NBI_CLAUDE_SETTING_SOURCE_USER_POLICY`, `NBI_CLAUDE_SETTING_SOURCE_PROJECT_POLICY`, `NBI_STORE_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_POLICY`. New value-presence locks: `NBI_CHAT_MODEL_PROVIDER`, `NBI_CHAT_MODEL_ID`, `NBI_INLINE_COMPLETION_MODEL_PROVIDER`, `NBI_INLINE_COMPLETION_MODEL_ID`, `NBI_CLAUDE_CHAT_MODEL`, `NBI_CLAUDE_INLINE_COMPLETION_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. See [README → Admin policies](README.md#admin-policies).
- `/claude-sessions` HTTP route accepts `?scope=cwd` to filter to sessions whose recorded `cwd` matches the lab's working directory.

### Changed

- Claude agent connection now happens in the background so JupyterLab finishes loading without waiting on the SDK handshake.

### Fixed

- Public-API hygiene in `notebook_intelligence.api`: `raise NotImplemented` → `raise NotImplementedError` (the former raised `TypeError` at the call site), `Toolset(tools=[])` and four other shared-default-argument cases corrected, `Signal.disconnect` tolerates double-disconnect with a debug-level log, registrar methods raise a new `RegistrationError` instead of silently logging.
- Claude headers (model + version) are now sent on inline completion calls, matching the chat path.
- OpenAI-compatible provider drops the unsupported `tool` `strict` flag when targeting vLLM (#108).
- Resolve symlinks when locating Claude session transcripts so `~/.claude/projects/` symlinked off another volume keeps working.
- Claude worker thread no longer crashes on cancellation; the chat loop recovers cleanly.
- "Generating..." row no longer reflows the chat sidebar on narrow widths.
- Skills popup in the chat sidebar dismisses on click-outside or when the input is cleared.
- Spurious "Skills reloaded" notification when launching a Claude session. The watcher now keys off a structural signature of bundle dirs + `SKILL.md` mtimes, ignoring sibling writes (`.DS_Store`, `.git/`, log/cache files) to the parent `~/.claude/skills/` directory.
- Traitlets `DeprecationWarning` ("Traits should be given as instances, not types") at startup is silenced for the `disabled_*` config.

### Internal

- CI runs `pytest tests/` and `jlpm test` on every PR. The `[test]` extra was added to `pyproject.toml`. Both build jobs declare `permissions: { contents: read }` so a compromised step can't push.

<!-- <END NEW CHANGELOG ENTRY> -->

## [4.6.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Claude Skills management panel** — Settings now exposes a **Skills** tab for managing the bundles Claude can invoke (SKILL.md frontmatter, helper files, allowed tools). Skills resolve from `~/.claude/skills/` (user) and `<project>/.claude/skills/` (project) — the same locations the Claude CLI reads. Inline editor, duplicate / rename / delete with undo, and import-from-GitHub via the public tarball API. For organization deployments, NBI can install a curated set from a YAML manifest pointed at by `NBI_SKILLS_MANIFEST` and keep them in sync; managed skills are read-only in the UI. See [`docs/skills.md`](docs/skills.md) for the full reference.
- Restructured documentation: `README.md` rewritten with a TOC and concept glossary, plus new `SECURITY.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, and operator guides under `docs/` (`admin-guide.md`, `rulesets.md`, `skills.md`, `troubleshooting.md`).

### Fixed

- **Windows Claude mode reliability** — Claude agent thread now uses the Proactor event loop on Windows, fixing subprocess spawn failures and intermittent "Claude agent not connected" races at startup. The Claude SDK retry path also reconnects when the worker thread has died instead of waiting out the full response timeout.
- Anthropic credentials are normalized (whitespace + scheme handling) before being passed to the SDK.
- Skill imports from GitHub reject tarball entries with absolute paths or `../` traversal — a malicious or buggy bundle can no longer write outside its install directory.
- `_send_claude_agent_request` guarded against the disconnect race that left chat handlers waiting on a closed queue.
- WebSocket message handlers are disconnected when the originating request finishes; previously they accumulated for the lifetime of the WebSocket.
- `configChanged` handlers are disconnected when components unmount, fixing a slow leak when the chat sidebar was opened and closed repeatedly.
- Claude session picker list scrolls correctly when the transcript count exceeds the visible area.

<!-- This entry was filled in retroactively after the 4.6.0 tag shipped. -->

## Versioning policy

- **Major (X.0.0)** — backward-incompatible changes to traitlets, environment variables, REST routes, or on-disk file formats. Major releases are accompanied by a migration note in this file.
- **Minor (4.Y.0)** — new features and traitlets. Existing configuration continues to work.
- **Patch (4.5.Z)** — bug fixes only.

Deprecations land in a minor release with a warning at startup, and are removed no earlier than the next major release.
